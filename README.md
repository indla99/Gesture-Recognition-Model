# Gesture Recognition Model

## Introduction
Welcome to the Hand Gesture Recognition Project! This project is dedicated to building and evaluating a model for recognizing hand gestures using the dataset available at [Sergiu Oprea's Hand Gesture Recognition Datasets](https://github.com/sergiuoprea/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Datasets). Our goal is to develop an accurate and efficient system for interpreting hand gestures, leveraging techniques like data normalization, Hidden Markov Models (HMM), and various algorithms.

## Dataset
The dataset can be found at [Sergiu Oprea's GitHub Repository](https://github.com/sergiuoprea/Hand-Gesture-Recognition-Datasets). It includes a comprehensive collection of hand gesture data that is pivotal for training and testing our model.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- Libraries: numpy, pandas, matplotlib, sklearn (Install using `pip install numpy pandas matplotlib sklearn`)

## Usage
### Normalizing the Data
Normalization is crucial for preparing the data for effective model training. Our scripts transform the raw data into a normalized format suitable for analysis.

### Building the Model
We use advanced techniques to construct a model capable of interpreting hand gestures. The model construction involves training with the normalized data.

### Evaluating the Test Data
After model construction, we evaluate its performance using a separate set of test data. This helps in understanding the accuracy and efficiency of our model.

### Finding the Best Configuration
We experiment with different configurations of the model to find the most optimal setup, ensuring high accuracy and performance.

### Sampling from the HMM
We utilize Hidden Markov Models for gesture recognition and sample data from these models to understand their behavior and efficacy.

### Comparing Samples
This involves a comparative analysis of the samples drawn from the model to evaluate consistency and reliability.

### The Forward Algorithm
Our project implements the Forward Algorithm for probabilistic computations in the context of HMM, enhancing the model's predictive capabilities.
